# Machine Learning Practice Repository

This repository is a **growing collection of Machine Learning notebooks** that will be added **one at a time** as part of continuous learning and practice.

Each notebook focuses on a **specific ML concept, algorithm, or evaluation technique**, using real-world or public datasets.

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

The objective of this repository is to:

- Practice core **Machine Learning concepts**
- Understand **model selection and evaluation**
- Apply **cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning**
- Maintain a clean, version-controlled ML workflow
- Showcase progressive learning through GitHub commits

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

- Each Machine Learning concept or experiment will be added as an **individual Jupyter Notebook**
- Notebooks will be uploaded **incrementally**, not all at once
- Each notebook is self-contained and focuses on a specific problem or technique

> This approach reflects real-world development where models and experiments evolve over time.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Language:** Python  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries (used as required):**
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn
